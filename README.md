## Introduction
The City Library Management System is a comprehensive software solution developed as part of the CS631 - Database Management System Design course at New Jersey Institute of Technology in Spring 2024, under the guidance of Professor Dimitri Theodoratos. This system facilitates efficient library management, including reader services and administrative functions, through a user-friendly interface. Designed using Java and MySQL, it adheres to the robust principles of database system design, ensuring reliability and ease of use.

## Installation

### Technical Stack
- **Backend Language**: Java
- **Database Connectivity**: MySQL
- **IDE / Tools**: MySQL Workbench, IntelliJ IDEA

### Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Java JDK: [Java SE Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk16-downloads.html)
- IntelliJ IDEA: [IntelliJ Download Page](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
- MySQL Workbench: [MySQL Workbench Download](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)

### Setting Up the Development Environment
1. **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Ensure Java is installed on your system. You can verify this by running `java -version` in your command line.
2. **IntelliJ IDEA:** Download and install IntelliJ IDEA, which will be used as the IDE for developing the Java application.
3. **MySQL Workbench:** Install MySQL Workbench, which will be used for designing, modeling, and managing the database.

## Usage

## Features
- **Reader Functions**: Search documents, checkout, return, reserve documents, compute fines, and more.
- **Administrative Functions**: Add document copies, search document status, add new readers, print branch information, analyze borrowing patterns, and more.
- **Sample Data**: Ample sample data in tables to demonstrate and test all functionalities.

### Running the Application
To run the City Library Management System, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/dd573Njit/DMSD_City_Library_G4`
2. **Database Setup**:
    - Install MySQL and MySQL Workbench.
    - Execute the SQL commands provided in the directory to create and populate the database.
3. **Application Setup**:
    - Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
    - Ensure Java JDK is installed and properly configured.
4. **Run the Application:**
    - Use IntelliJ IDEA to compile and run the application.
    - Navigate through the menus to explore the functionalities provided for both readers and administrative staff.

## Project Demonstration
Project demonstrations will be scheduled and announced in class. Reserve a time slot for showcasing the functionalities and design of the system.

## Issues and Solutions
During the development of this project, we encountered several challenges, including database schema design complexities and integration issues between the front-end and back-end. Solutions involved thorough testing, collaborative problem-solving, and continuous iteration of our approach.


## Acknowledgments
